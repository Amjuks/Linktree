Hey there! I’ve been diving into the world of coding for about seven years now, and it’s been an amazing journey. I started with Scratch, which was a fun introduction, and then I jumped into learning C as my first programming language. From there, I explored SQL, Java, and even picked up C# for some light game development in Unity.

My real passion, though, lies in AI and machine learning, along with web development. I love creating things, and some of my latest projects include building image classifiers and generators for numbers and beautiful sceneries.

I got my start with some great courses from Harvard and earned certificates that helped me build a strong foundation. Since then, I’ve been mostly self-taught, exploring new technologies and pushing my limits.

These days, I’m focused on expanding my skills in AIML and web development, always excited to learn more and tackle new challenges. Let’s connect and share ideas!
